## Template Method ##
-> skeleton of an algorithm in the baseclass and lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without
changing its structure.




## Pros ##
->  You can pull the duplicate code into a superclass.
-> You can let clients override only certain parts of a large algorithm, making them less affected by changes
that happen to other parts of the algorithm.
