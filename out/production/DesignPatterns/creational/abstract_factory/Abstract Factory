## Abstract Factory design pattern ##

-> almost similar to Factory Pattern except the fact that its more like factory of factories.

-> If you are familiar with factory design pattern in java, you will notice that we have a single Factory class.
This factory class returns different subclasses based on the input provided and factory class uses if-else
or switch statement to achieve this.

-> In the Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class.
Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class.

# Abstract Factory Design Pattern Benefits#

1- Abstract Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.
2- Abstract Factory pattern is “factory of factories” and can be easily extended to accommodate more
  products, for example we can add another sub-class Laptop and a factory LaptopFactory.
3- Abstract Factory pattern is robust and avoid conditional logic of Factory pattern.
